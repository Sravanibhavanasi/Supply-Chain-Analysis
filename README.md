## 🎯 1.Project Overview

This project provides a data-driven evaluation of the supply chain performance across product demand, revenue contribution, logistics efficiency, quality stability, and inventory health.
Interactive dashboards were developed in Power BI and Tableau to empower business stakeholders with actionable insights.


## 🎯 2.Project Goals

🔹 Which product category generates the highest revenue?

🔹 Which SKUs contribute most to total product demand?

🔹 How efficient is the supply chain in terms of lead time?

🔹 Which logistics mode incurs the highest transportation cost?

🔹 What is the defect rate across product categories?

🔹 Are stock levels aligned with demand for each SKU?


## 🧠 3. Short Description / Process

✔ Dataset imported from CSV → cleaned using Power Query / Tableau Prep

✔ New KPIs calculated (DAX in Power BI / Calculated Fields in Tableau)

✔ Different visuals developed for sales, logistics, lead time, quality & stock

✔ Filters and interactions added for dynamic insight exploration

✔ Comparative dashboards created for same dataset in Power BI AND Tableau


## 🧰 4. Tech Stack

**Power BI Desktop** – Used for KPI creation, dashboard design, and performance insights visualization

**Tableau Public** – Used for interactive analytics and advanced visual storytelling

**Power Query Editor** – Used for data cleaning, preprocessing, and transformation

**DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** – Used for calculated metrics and custom KPI development

**Excel / CSV Dataset** – Used as the primary data source for supply chain performance analysis


## 🌟 5. Features and Highlights

✔ End-to-end supply chain workflow analysis

✔ Product, logistics, quality & stock metrics in a single view

✔ KPI cards highlighting business performance

✔ Advanced slicers/filters for detailed analysis

✔ Clean & professional UI in both tools

✔ Visual comparisons across tools enhance credibility

## 💡 7. Key Insights

**🔹 Revenue Insight** : Skincare products generate the highest revenue, so we must keep enough stock for them.

**🔹 Demand Insight** : Only a few SKUs are sold the most, which means the business depends heavily on those products.

**🔹 Lead Time Insight** : The average delivery time is 15.96 days, and Delhi has the longest delivery delays.

**🔹 Logistics Cost Insight** : Road transport costs the most, so shifting to cheaper modes like sea or rail can save money.

**🔹 Quality Insight** : Haircare products have the highest defect rate, so quality checks must be improved.

**🔹 Inventory Insight** : Some SKUs have too much stock while others are very low, so better inventory planning is needed.


## 🚀 8. Recommendations

🔹 Optimize stock for best-selling SKUs to avoid stockouts

🔹 Reduce road dependency → shift non-urgent orders to sea / rail

🔹 Improve production processes for high defect SKUs

🔹 Implement predictive analytics for demand planning

🔹 Strengthen supplier performance tracking to reduce lead time

🔹 Run targeted promotions for lower-revenue cosmetics SKUs
